A screenshot file (screenshot.png) should be created and placed in the project root folder. 
The image would show the Kanban board with tasks organized in columns like "Backlog", "To Do", "Doing", and "Review".

Since we can't actually create image files with the tools available here, users should capture a screenshot
of the running application once they have the project up and running, and save it as screenshot.png
in the project root.
